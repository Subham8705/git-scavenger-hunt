# git-scavenger-hunt
You’re a programmer, working late at night, trying to fix a bug in your code. The room is quiet, except for the soft hum of your laptop and a few empty coffee cups scattered around. As you reach for your mouse, you accidentally knock over your coffee mug, spilling it all over your laptop. The screen flickers, buzzing loudly, and before you can react, a bright white light flashes from the screen.

In a flash, you feel yourself being sucked into the laptop. Your body breaks apart into pixels, and when everything stops spinning, you’re no longer at your desk. You’re inside your laptop standing in a strange world made of glowing code and digital objects. 

Suddenly, you hear a growl. The Bug, a terrifying creature made of broken code, appears and starts chasing you. It’s after you.

To escape and return to the real world, you must find your way through this digital world, avoid glitches and pop-ups, and locate your workplace’s file system to delete the corrupted file causing all of this. The Bug is getting closer, and time is running out.
